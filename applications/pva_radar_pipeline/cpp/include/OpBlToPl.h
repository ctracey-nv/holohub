/** 
 * Constructs an operator instance for converting an image from Block Linear (BL) layout to Pitch Linear (PL) layout.
 * This operator is specifically designed to work with images in the NV12 format only.
 *
 * PL (Pitch Linear) is the layout of most ordinary images, where elements are arranged row by row and elements within
 * the same row are consecutive in memory. BL (Block Linear) 
 * <a href="https://docs.nvidia.com/drive/drive_os_5.1.6.1L/nvvib_docs/index.html#page/DRIVE_OS_Linux_SDK_Development_Guide/NvMedia/nvmedia_concept_surface.html">block linear</a> 
 * is a proprietary layout. Compared to PL layout, on a 32 bytes x 2 rows granularity (referred to as 32x2), BL layout means the elements are
 * permuted as follows:
 * + Bytes within the 32x2 are permuted.
 * + Different 32x2 blocks within the image are also permuted.
 * 
 * NV12 is a YUV semi-planar format that has two planes: one for the Y plane and the other for the interleaved UV plane.
 * The UV plane is subsampled, with its image width and height being half of that of the Y plane's. For both PL and BL,
 * the layout refers to a per-plane basis; there is no permutation of blocks across planes. 
 *
 * \b Input:
 *      Data Layout:    [BL]
 *      
 *      Image Format:   NVCV_IMAGE_FORMAT_NV12 or NVCV_IMAGE_FORMAT_NV12_ER
 *                      Note that NVCV APIs do not support NVCV_IMAGE_FORMAT_NV12_BL or NVCV_IMAGE_FORMAT_NV12_ER_BL,
 *                    otherwise they will be more accurate.
 *
 *
 * \b Output:
 *      Data Layout:    [PL]
 * 
 *      Image Format:   NVCV_IMAGE_FORMAT_NV12 or NVCV_IMAGE_FORMAT_NV12_ER

 * \b Input/Output \b Dependency:
 *      Property    | Input == Output
 *     -------------| -------------
 *      Data Layout | No
 *      Image Format| Yes
 *
 *
 * @param [out] handle Where the operator instance handle will be written to.
 *                     + Must not be NULL.
 *
 * @param [in] imageRequirements Pointer to the NVCVImageRequirements structure which contains image width, height,
 *                               data type information, and output image's line pitch.
 *                               + Note that the line pitch for BL layout is implicitly determined by the image width,
 *                                 so cannot be explicitly specified.
 *
 * @retval NVCV_ERROR_INVALID_ARGUMENT       Possible cases include:
 *                                            1) The handle or imageRequirements are either NULL or point to an invalid address.
 *                                            2) The NV12 format itself is incorrect, e.g., having an odd number of rows or columns.
 *                                            3) The image size is smaller than the minimum required size of 32x4.
 *                                            4) Incorrect tile size for the given image size, as the tile size is currently hardcoded.
 *
 * @retval NVCV_ERROR_OUT_OF_MEMORY         Not enough memory to create the operator.
 * @retval NVCV_SUCCESS                     Operation executed successfully.
